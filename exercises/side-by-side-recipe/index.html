                    These garlic feta shawarma beef bowls are one of those meals
                    that hit every craving at once. The ground beef is deeply 
                    spiced and saucy, the garlic feta dressing is creamy and 
                    tangy, and everything comes together perfectly over warm 
                    yellow rice. Simple ingredients, big flavor, and exactly the
                    kind of bowl I love making on repeat.
