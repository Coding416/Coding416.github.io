                    Across the iPhone 17 Pro camera system, you’ll find 
                    innovation that goes to great lengths. The telephoto 
                    features the next generation of our tetraprism design and a 
                    56 percent larger sensor. With an equivalent 200 mm focal 
                    length, the 8x optical-quality zoom makes this the longest 
                    iPhone Telephoto ever — offering 16x total optical zoom 
                    range. So you can explore an even wider range of creative 
                    choices and add a longer reach to your compositions.
