            Fried Chicken

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken: We use the whole bird instead of buying individual 
                chicken pieces. Cutting up a whole chicken creates a nice 
                assortment of white and dark meat while also ensuring all the 
                pieces are cut into even sizes.  
            </li>

            <li>The batter: We tackle the chicken coating in two steps. First, 
                there’s a batter of flour, eggs and water. This evenly coats the
                chicken and prevents the breading from falling off. Next, we 
                dip the chicken in seasoned flour, which helps the chicken 
                become as crispy as possible when it hits the hot oil. 
            </li>
            <li>The seasonings: We use a flavorful mixture of garlic salt, 
                paprika, black pepper and poultry seasoning. This blend includes
                dried sage, thyme, rosemary, marjoram and nutmeg. If you don’t 
                have garlic salt on hand, mix your own by combining one part 
                garlic powder with three parts salt (i.e., one teaspoon garlic 
                powder and three teaspoons salt).
            </li>
            <li>Oil: The best oils for frying are neutral oils, like canola and
                safflower oil. Their higher smoke points make them ideal for 
                frying chicken and other foods.
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3> Directions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>       
            Dredge the chicken: In a large shallow dish, combine 2-2/3 cups of 
            the flour with the garlic salt, paprika, 2-1/2 teaspoons of the 
            pepper and the poultry seasoning. In a separate shallow dish, 
            briefly beat the eggs with the water before adding the salt, 
            remaining 1-1/3 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
            Dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture and then into the 
            flour mixture. Turn each piece until it is fully coated.  
            </li>
            <li> 
            Fry the chicken: Heat the oil to 375°F in an electric skillet or 
            deep-fat fryer. Fry the chicken a few pieces at a time, being 
            areful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook until the chicken is golden 
            brown and the juices run clear, about seven to eight minutes per 
            side. Drain the chicken on a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack.
            Editor’s Tip: Hold the chicken warm in a 250° oven while you cook 
            the remaining pieces. Keeping the chicken elevated will keep it 
            crispy, so we like to line a baking sheet with an ovenproof cooling 
            rack.
