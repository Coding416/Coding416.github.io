        <h4>Dessert</h4>
        <h3>Chocolate Mousse Cups</h3>
        <p>
            For all my chocolate lovers, these mousse cups are the ultimate 
            silky, rich, spoon-worthy treat. They look fancy but come together 
            with just a few simple steps and a quick chill. Every bite is light,
            creamy, and so chocolatey and I have a feeling you’re going to be 
            obsessed.

            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>CHANTILLY CREAM</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>  
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h4>CRUST</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the Oreos to a food processor and pulse until very fine 
                crumbs form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the crumbs to a mixing bowl. Pour in the melted butter 
                and mix until the texture feels like wet sand.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Chocolate Mousse</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chopped chocolate in a medium heat-safe bowl.</li>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add the heavy cream, 
                butter, and sugar. Whisk until the mixture is hot and the sugar 
                is dissolved, but do not let it boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate, cover the bowl, 
                and let it sit undisturbed for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Uncover and whisk from the center outward until completely 
                smooth and glossy. Let it cool slightly so it’s warm but not 
                hot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk in the egg yolks until fully combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the espresso powder, vanilla extract, and a tiny pinch of 
                salt, then whisk again until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, whip the chilled heavy cream with a hand 
                mixer or whisk until soft peaks form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the whipped cream to the chocolate mixture in batches, 
                gently folding after each addition until the mousse is light and
                airy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the mousse, transfer to the fridge, and set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>CHANTILLY CREAM</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a clean bowl, add the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and 
                vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>Whip with a hand mixer or whisk until soft peaks form.</li>
            <h4>ASSEMBLE</h4>
            <li>
                Add a few spoonfuls of the crust mixture to the bottom of each 
                cup and press down lightly to form an even layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon or pipe the chocolate mousse on top so each cup fills 
                about two-thirds to three-quarters of the way up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finish the remaining space with Chantilly or whipped cream.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy right away, or cover each jar and refrigerate for up to 3 
                days.
            </li>
        </ol>
